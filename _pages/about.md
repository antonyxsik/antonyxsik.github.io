About Me
------
I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://ams.mines.edu/) at the Colorado School of Mines, where I am a member of the Mines Optimization and Deep Learning group ([MODL](https://ams.mines.edu/optimization-and-deep-learning/)). My research interests lie on the intersection of deep learning and statistics, particularly in developing methods to efficiently work with big spatial data. 



I am a student researcher at the [Payne Institute for Public Policy](https://payneinstitute.mines.edu/), a data-focused research institute associated with the School of Mines, where I work on the [Responsible Gas Initiative](https://www.mines.edu/global-energy-future/responsiblegas/). I am also a Core Member of the Methane Emissions Technology Alliance ([META](https://ngi.stanford.edu/events-news/meta-seminars)), a Stanford-led group of researchers and practitioners focused on detection and mitigation of methane emissions. My research group is a part of the Energy Emissions Modeling and Data Lab ([EEMDL](https://www.eemdl.utexas.edu/)), an initiative seeking to develop transparent models and datasets for accurate greenhouse gas emissions accounting across global oil and gas supply chains.

I have previously collaborated with atmospheric scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) on interpretable models for explaining [fire season intensity](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JD036774) and with physicists studying [ELVES](https://wsdaniels.github.io/files/2019_daniels_physics_senior_design.pdf).

I am originally from Seattle, WA, where I liked to hike and sail. I now live in Boulder, CO, where I have picked up cycling and Nordic skiing. When I am not outside or working, I like to read and play board games.
