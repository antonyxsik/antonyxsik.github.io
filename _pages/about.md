About Me
------
I am a PhD candidate and NSF GRFP Fellow in the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://ams.mines.edu/) at the Colorado School of Mines. I recently concluded my MS in Data Science here at Mines, and before that, I received my BS in Applied Mathematics from the University of California, San Diego.


My research interests lie on the intersection of deep learning and statistics, particularly in developing methods to efficiently work with big spatial data. I am especially interested in interpretable ML methods, both for AI safety and for enabling scientists to assign physical significance to their models. I am a member of the Mines Optimization and Deep Learning group ([MODL](https://ams.mines.edu/optimization-and-deep-learning/)), and am also affiliated with the Learning the Earth with Artificial Intelligence and Physics ([LEAP](https://leap.columbia.edu/education/2024-leap-summer-momentum-fellowship/)) NSF Science Technology Center.

When I'm not working, I like to spend my time skiing, longboarding, attending live music shows, and eating really spicy food! 

News
------
- **(June 2024)** Our paper "Normalizing Basis Functions: Approximate Stationary Models for Large Spatial Data" has been posted on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13821).
- **(May 2024)** I have been selected to perform research and co-mentor undergraduate students as a Momentum Fellow at LEAP, an NSF center focused on combining AI and climate science!
- **(April 2024)** Excited to announce that I have been awarded the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (NSF GRFP)!
