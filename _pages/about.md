About Me
------
I'm a PhD candidate and NSF GRFP Fellow in the <a href="https://ams.mines.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics</a> at the Colorado School of Mines. I completed my MS in Data Science at Mines and earned a BS in Applied Mathematics from the University of California, San Diego.


My research interests lie on the intersection of deep learning and statistics, particularly in developing methods to efficiently work with big spatial data. I am especially interested in interpretable ML methods, both for AI safety and for enabling scientists to assign physical significance to their models. I am affiliated with the Mines Optimization and Deep Learning group (<a href="https://ams.mines.edu/optimization-and-deep-learning/" target="_blank">MODL</a>), and have previously worked at: Reality Labs at <a href="https://tech.facebook.com/reality-labs/" target="_blank">Meta</a>, the Learning the Earth with Artificial Intelligence and Physics (<a href="https://leap.columbia.edu/education/2024-leap-summer-momentum-fellowship/" target="_blank">LEAP</a>) NSF Science & Technology Center, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (<a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">JPL</a>), and <a href="https://www.excelitas.com/" target="_blank">Excelitas Technologies</a> . I am advised by <a href="https://danielmckenzie.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Daniel McKenzie</a> and <a href="https://dnychka.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Doug Nychka</a>.

When I'm not working, I like to spend my time skiing, longboarding, going to concerts, lifting, and eating really spicy food!
