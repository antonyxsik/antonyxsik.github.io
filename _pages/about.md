About Me
------
I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://ams.mines.edu/) at the Colorado School of Mines, where I am a member of the Mines Optimization and Deep Learning group ([MODL](https://ams.mines.edu/optimization-and-deep-learning/)). My research interests lie on the intersection of deep learning and statistics, particularly in developing methods to efficiently work with big spatial data. I recently concluded my MS in Data Science here at Mines, and before that, I received my BS in Applied Mathematics from University of California, San Diego. When I'm not at work, I like spending time skiing, longboarding, attending live music shows, and eating spicy food!
