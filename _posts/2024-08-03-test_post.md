Finding Equations with Machine Learning to Make Climate Models More Accurate  
------

The Earth’s climate is a complicated system. To make sense of it, and to predict the impact of our actions on our climate, scientists need accurate climate models, called Earth System Models (ESMs). ESMs help scientists make forecasts by simulating interactions between the atmosphere, biosphere, cryosphere, land, and oceans. However, these massive computer simulations are expensive to run, often requiring months of supercomputer time. Because of this, they are run at a coarse resolution, chopping up the Earth into 100 x 100 kilometer grid cells, and reporting key measurements such as temperature and humidity for each cell. As each grid cell is larger than the entire state of Rhode Island, this resolution is often far too coarse to properly model, or "resolve", the effects of small scale events, such as a minor thunderstorm and its subsequent flash flooding. Although these events may be on the order of a few meters or kilometers, they can have drastic impacts on the accuracy of long term predictions. This is because our climate is a chaotic system, and small initial changes can result in large differences over time – a phenomenon commonly referred to as the butterfly effect.

Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) constitute a set of algorithms that learn patterns through data, and have become ubiquitous in our society through technologies like ChatGPT, self-driving cars, and targeted advertising. Due to their ability to efficiently ingest large volumes of data, ML methods present themselves as strong candidates for improving climate predictions by modeling these critical, small scale processes. A key concern is the black-box nature of many ML algorithms: it is often difficult to understand how these complex models arrive at their conclusions. For a prediction to be meaningful, the model must also be interpretable; scientists need to trust and understand the results to assign physical significance to the model’s outputs.
